Hi, I'm Pine. I previously worked on Visual Studio Code at Microsoft and on [Underlay](https://www.underlay.org) at [Knowledge Futures Group](https://www.knowledgefutures.org). 

I [left](https://blog.matsu.io/on-leaving) behind a corporate job and started living nomadically. Recently, I'm doing independent study/research, reading a lot, learning about coffee and bread-making, building projects for fun and learning languages (Rust and French).

I aim to become an Information Architect. In the literary level, I work to organize and present information at the right place & time. In a figurative sense, I try to approach programming with empathy and ethics, despite programming itself being a very technical endeavor.

Some projects that I work on:

- [Vetur](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur): An editor plugin for Vue.js in Visual Studio Code.
- [Shiki](http://npmjs.com/package/shiki): A better source code highlighter.
- [Polacode](https://github.com/octref/polacode): Polaroid for your code.

I have setup a [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/octref) to keep my Open Source work sustainable. My current focus is Vetur, but my overarching goal is to devise tool/language/media that bring out expression otherwise unexpressible.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/octref) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/octref).
