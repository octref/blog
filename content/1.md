Here is a guide to debugging Electron App with VS Code. It works on all platforms, and includes
instruction for debugging both Main and Renderer process.

I'll be using [electron/electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start).
Clone and open the project in VS Code. Then go to the Debug View and click the configure icon
to make an empty `launch.json`.

You can also skip this tutorial and grab the code at: [octref/vscode-electron-debug](https://github.com/octref/vscode-electron-debug)

## Main Process

Fill `launch.json` with the following.

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug Main Process",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
      "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron",
      "windows": {
        "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd"
      },
      "program": "${workspaceRoot}/main.js",
      "protocol": "legacy",
    }
  ]
}
```

The setting is pretty self-explanatory, use the `electron` in `node_modules` to run `main.js`.
If you go to the Debug View and run `Debug Main Process`, you should see the code stopping
at the breakpoints in `main.js`.

## Renderer Process

Making Renderer process work involves more effort, but as most of Electron App's code
lives in Renderer Process, it is of more interest.

First, a high-level explanation as to how we'll make it work. Electron has a launch flag 
`--remote-debugging-port`, which lets you specify a port for remote debugging. The language
spoken at this port is [Chrome Debugging Protocol]
(https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/debugger-protocol),
and VS Code has an extension that just handles that: [Debugger for Chrome]
(https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome).

### Setting up

#### Go to `main.js` and comment out this line:

```js
mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools()
```
Remote debugging doesn't work with multiple DevTools clients. We'll use the debugger in VS Code
instead of Electron's DevTools.

#### Install Debugger for Chrome

Launch Quick Open, and enter `ext install debugger-for-chrome`.

#### Add a new configuration in `launch.json`

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug Renderer Process",
      "type": "chrome",
      "request": "launch",
      "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron",
      "windows": {
        "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd"
      },
      "runtimeArgs": [
        "${workspaceRoot}/main.js",
        "--remote-debugging-port=9222"
      ],
      "webRoot": "${workspaceRoot}"
    }
  ]
}
```

Most of the configuration is straightforward. 9222 is the port Debugger for Chrome uses
by default, and `webRoot` tells Debugger for Chrome the location of the source code that
we want to debug for.

#### Add some code to `renderer.js`

```js
console.log('hello world!')

document.body.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log('hello vscode!')
})
```

Now we are ready to go.

### Debugging

I added two breakpoints in `renderer.js`, and ran `Debug Renderer Process` in the Debug View.

{{< figure src="/img/1/renderer_process.png" >}}

Electron will stop on the second breakpoint if I click anywhere in the window:

{{< figure src="/img/1/renderer_process_click.png" >}}

However, it wouldn't hit the first breakpoint. The reason is Debugger for Chrome would
first launch Electron, and try to attach to the running process to debug it. When it
successfully attached itself, the first `console.log` had already been executed.

The solution is to go to the Electron window and press `cmd+r` to reload, Electron will
re-execute the renderer and hit the breakpoint.

### Transpiling

Most modern Web apps are written in languages that transpile to JavaScript. If sourcemaps are
generated during transpilation, we can debug the original code in VS Code.

I modified [electron/electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start)
to use Babel and Webpack to transpile ES6 code. Here I'm debugging the un-transpiled code:

Details are in this commit: [4bb4a93](https://github.com/octref/vscode-electron-debug/commit/4bb4a93)

## Why all the hassle?

You get all the nice features in VS Code while debugging, like:

- [Go to Definition](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_go-to-definition)
- [Peek definition](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_peek)
- Use Vim commands to jump around, thanks to [VSCodeVim](http://aka.ms/vscodevim)
- Code folding

When inspecting DOM, I still need to go back to Chrome DevTools.
But I find myself debugging much faster in VS Code, which I use everyday for coding.
