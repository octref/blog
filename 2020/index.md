End my worrability.

Against information consumerism.  
Against aesthetic consumerism.

Stop accumulating information.  
Build knowledge.  
Acquire understanding.

Write more.  
Prose or code.

Slow down,  
do useless things.

Learn languages.  
Racket. Smalltalk.  
Icelandic. French. Russian.

Learn,  
and teach.

Make tools to aid myself,  
and others.

Live a frugal routine.  
Keep running.  
Keep looking for good coffee.
Start making coffee.

Learn to care and love.
